# Note: This would be an actual Excel file, but since we cannot generate binary files,
# this file should be created using the create_sample_excel() function in utils.py
# The file contains two sheets:
# Sheet 1 "Maszyny": Column with machine names (MARTIN, JUMBO, DOMINO, HEIDELBERG, KOLBUS)
# Sheet 2 "Pytania": Two columns - code and description with 5S audit questions
